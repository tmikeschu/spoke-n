# The Spoken Tour
Some friends of mine are going to bike from Denver, Colorado to Buenos Aires, Argentina, so I helped build their travel blog using React (thanks to [CRA](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [RGM](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps)).

You can find the repo for the Rails API I built for this app [here](https://github.com/tmikeschu/spoke-n-api).
