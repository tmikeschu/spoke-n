      <h2>Who</h2>
      <p>We are a pair of lunatics who lack the social awareness and cultural couth to know where we belong in the world.  Pretty offensive, we know.  We met on the first day of college.  Ugh, typical liberal, transcendentalist yahoos, we know.  We graduated, took some jobs, and found out about work.  That it’s important, and that we’re going to be doing it for a long time.  We want to take some agency over our work and try our hands at something creative, unique, challenging, and, ultimately, something dope.  So we’re strapping a bunch of stuff to our bicycles and going for it.  “But aren’t you guys gonna get sick of one another?”  Undoubtedly, yes.  Yes we will.  But that’s why we’re bringing crossword puzzles.</p>

      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>Two wheels and human power is the theme of this (approximately) 15,000 mi-long trip, which is great because the ratio of kilocalories of energy input to kilometers of distance covered cycling is super efficient.  Actually more so than travel by motorcycle, automobile, or train.  And way more so than swimming.  Could you imagine swimming to South America?!  No thanks.  Plus, we love the feeling of independence that you feel on the seat of your bike.  Knowing that you’ve got everything you need strapped to this rocket between your thighs, and that you, and you alone, are in control of the joystick.  Tough feeling to beat.  We recommend it to everyone.</p>

    <section className="where">
      <h2>Where</h2>
      <p>Well when it comes to independence, there simply is no other landmass that craves self-determination and sovereignty like the Americas.  By our calculations, every single country in North and South America, with the exception of Canada, has run the gauntlet of national revolution for independence.  We respect that.  And we love the language and also eating empanadas.  All of these critical factors played an important role in our decision making, but it is really the topography of the Americas that yanked our imaginations the most violently.  Sun-scorched deserts, thousands of miles of coastline, tropical jungles, towering volcanoes and the longest mountain range on the planet.  We want to see as much of it as we can.</p>

    <section className="why">
      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>Our purpose is to abandon routine and slow ourselves down. Adapting to our surroundings and embracing our challenges; forsaking acceleration in favor of presence.  There is never a perfect time for any enormous endeavor—but, dammit, we want to do something big while our bodies are young and our minds are uncorrupted by decades of cynicism...so by that measure, maybe this is OUR perfect time.  An author that we both enjoy once wrote “The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.”  Although Jon Krakauer did not personally ask us to test his hypothesis, we feel it is our duty to diligently conduct this experiment and uncover the truth…or at least a vague estimation of it.</p>
