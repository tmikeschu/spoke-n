    We are producing a podcast as we pedal south.  We are aiming to release an episode every 2 weeks, this, of course, depends on where in the world we are and whether or not we are able to upload. We'll be covering everything from local culture and interviews, to gear reviews and mechanical mishaps, to personal diatribes and shoutouts to Grandma.

    Episodes of The Spoken Tour will be available for download via iTunes, SoundCloud, Stitcher and a couple additional sites.

Leave us comments about the show on our
